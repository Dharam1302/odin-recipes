    <b><h2>Ingredients:</h2></b><br>

    <ul>
        <li>140g wholemeal flour</li><br>
        <li>140g plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li><br>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li><br>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing</li><br>
        <li>180ml hot water or as needed</li><br>
        
    </ul><br>

    <b><h2>Preparation:</h2></b>

    <ol>
        <li>STEP 1 <br>
            In a large bowl, stir together the flours and salt. Use a wooden spoon to stir in the olive oil and enough water to make a soft dough that is elastic but not sticky.</li><br>
        <li>STEP 2 <br>
            Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 5-10 mins until it is smooth. Divide into 10 pieces, or less if you want bigger breads. Roll each piece into a ball. Let rest for a few mins.</li><br>
        <li>STEP 3 <br>
            Heat a frying pan over medium heat until hot, and grease lightly. On a lightly floured surface, use a floured rolling pin to roll out the balls of dough until very thin like a tortilla.</li><br>
        <li>STEP 4 <br>
            When the pan starts smoking, put a chapati on it. Cook until the underside has brown spots, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook on the other side. Put on a plate and keep warm while you cook the rest of the chapatis.</li><br>
